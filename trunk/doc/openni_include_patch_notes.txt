In order to use OpenNI with mingw under windows, the platform file must be changed:
- so that the "linux" variant of include is called
- yet that the __stdcall calling convention is used.

These following must be changed:

1) Change XnPlatform.h:


#if defined(__MINGW32__) // gcc-windows
   #include "mingw-win32/XnPlatformLinux-x86.h"
#elif (_WIN32) // Microsoft Visual Studio

2) Copy Include/Linux-x86 to Include/mingw-win32

3) Change XnPlatformLinux-x86.h:

// Changed callback type for gcc-windows (mingw) compiles to include the stdcall decoration:
#define XN_CALLBACK_TYPE XN_STDCALL
